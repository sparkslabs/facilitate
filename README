The purpose of this directory tree is to show what's needed for a single
entity in the system. 

The following 2 files are needed to implement the "Missions" entity:

    missions & Missions.py

In "templates" the following files exist for this entity:

    Missions.View.tmpl
    Mission.View.tmpl
    Mission.Edit.tmpl

They have the following purposes:

   Missions.View.tmpl
      List view of all mission entities (can & does skip fields)

   Mission.View.tmpl
      View a single mission entity

   Mission.Edit.tmpl
      Edit a single mission entity

More generally this means you need to have:

   entities & Entities.py

   templates/
        Entities.View.tmpl
        Entity.View.tmpl
        Entity.Edit.tmpl
       
In order to have the core code and templates.

Finally the code has to be pulled into the main page template.

Specifically the following are needed in templates/Page.tmpl in order
for the "missions" entity set to be active:

    #def $missionsappurl: /cgi-bin/app/missions

    #def $addmissionurl: $missionsappurl?formtype=edit_new
    #def $addmission: <a href="$addmissionurl">Add</a>
    #def $missionshomelink: <a href="$missionsappurl">Home</a>

    <td align="center" style="border: 3px solid; padding: 8;"> 
       Mission<br>($missionshomelink | $addmission) 
    </td>

Or more generally:
    #def $entitiesappurl: /cgi-bin/app/entities

    #def $addentityurl: $entitiesappurl?formtype=edit_new
    #def $addentity: <a href="$addentityurl">Add</a>
    #def $entitieshomelink: <a href="$entitiesappurl">Home</a>

    <td align="center" style="border: 3px solid; padding: 8;"> 
       Entity<br>($entitieshomelink | $addentity) 
    </td>

In summary:

  Clone (say missions) & edit: 
     entities & Entities.py

     templates/
          Entities.View.tmpl
          Entity.View.tmpl
          Entity.Edit.tmpl

  Edit:
     templates/Page.tmpl
