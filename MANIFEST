A step through the file system (at some point this will have to have a
radical restructure, but this is a snapshot of *now* (April 9th 2008)

.
./missions        | The cgi script
./Missions.py     | The code the cgi script calls
./bbcwsgitools.py | Used by the cgi script to simplify "Missions.py"

./model                | For handling storage & retrieval of records
./model/Record.py     
./model/__init__.py
./model/test_Record.py

./uploads              | Uploads get dumped in here. There are obviously
                       | some issues here, but the mechanism for getting
                       | them here does work - which is the key thing at
                       | this stage.

./data                 | A new directory for each entity set will be created
./data/missions        | here
./data/missions/0      | The file names are actually the entity ids.
./data/missions/1      | For convenience the <entity>id is included in the 
./data/missions/2      | JSON object
./data/missions/3      | Each file stores one JSON object
./data/missions/.meta  | Metadata about the records stored here

./templates            
./templates/Page.tmpl  | You add to this template (at present)for each new
                       | entity

./templates/Form.tmpl       | Used for "normal" forms 
./templates/Form.Post.tmpl  | Used for post forms, especially those which
                            | are uploads


./templates/Mission.Edit.tmpl   | These are entity set specific, and you
./templates/Mission.View.tmpl   | would create more of these for your
./templates/Missions.View.tmpl  | entity set/entities
