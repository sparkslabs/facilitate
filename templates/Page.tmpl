<P>
<B> Base mission flag needs adding to Mission <br>
Editting of record attributes for uploads should not clobber the upload as it presently does </b>
<P>
<B>Need to update this such that the "update" template makes it much clearer you're editting a record, rather than creating a new one.</B>
<P> Note that the code has been refactored somewhat to simplify extension to other datatypes whilst allowing code specific stuff to occur. Further refactoring is needed after we complete showing &amp; making relations, along with the aspect of subset viewing, creation &amp; update. Certainly a start however.
<P><i> OK, next steps:
<ul>
    <li> Need to handle upload of BLOBs...
    <ul>
        <li> Can handle now uploads of several pictures at once into the collab platform
        <li> Stored in /tmp/uploads/<i>number</i>
        <ul>
            Moved to CWD/uploads for now - will need to be reconfigurable
        </ul>
        <li> Also in environ["bbc.args"] as "field" &amp; &lt;field&gt;.__filename pairs.
        <li> Needs thinking about slightly more there, but that works pretty well for something hardcoded.
    </ul>
    <li> Now need to add in a way to view the uploaded content - which goes a long way to the next 2 points
    <ul>
        <li> Have basic viewing of content now sorted, but will need placing behind some protection
        <li> That shouldn't be an issue though?
    </ul>
    <li> Update item needs to *replace* the existing file.
    <ul>
        <li> Check that this really is happening correctly. (Not clear)
        <li> Actually, we know that updating of blobs is bust - find out why.
        <li> Need to constructively handle empty files too.
    </ul>
    <li> A database based around BLOBS (contributed data)
    <li> A database around BLOBS with metadata
    <li> A database of associations between the Blobby database and the person database.
    <li> Then will need to handle deletion of blobs &amp; content properly.
</ul>
